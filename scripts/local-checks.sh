# the registry over the network: every tarball comes from the cache, checked
# against the lockfile's integrity hash. --ignore-scripts runs no package code
# at install. That keeps the intent of Erik's npm guard (no fresh downloads,
# no install-time package code) while testing exactly the locked packages, not
# a developer's node_modules. Both flags hold only for registry tarballs: npm
# clones a git dependency from the network and runs its prepare scripts
# regardless. So npm's git is set to false (every git dependency, from
# package.json, a lockfile or a shrinkwrap, fails without running git), and
# the lockfile is refused up front if any entry is not served by the registry
# (git, file, link, another host), or if an npm-shrinkwrap.json would
# override it. A tarball the cache cannot supply (missing, or failing its
# integrity hash, which npm treats as missing) fails with its name@version;
# there is no network fallback. Decided by the Architect for Erik, 2026-10-02
# (agent-runtime-config #7828).
