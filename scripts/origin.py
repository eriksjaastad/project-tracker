"""Origin resolution — which agent/context filed this card.

Used to populate the ``created_by`` field on tasks. Derives a short label
from a caller's cwd so the CLI, MCP server, and any future surface all
tag provenance consistently.

Two entry points:

* :func:`project_from_cwd` — pure function. Takes a cwd string, returns
  the label. Used by any code that already knows which cwd to resolve
  (e.g. rows from ai-memory's ``skill_invocations`` table).
* :func:`resolve_created_by` — convenience wrapper that reads the caller's
  own cwd (honouring ``PT_CALLER_CWD``) and delegates to
  :func:`project_from_cwd`.
