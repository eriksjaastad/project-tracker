"""Client-side unique ID generator (pt #6044).

Background
----------
Rows are keyed by 63-bit integer IDs minted at insert time instead of by
SQLite's rowid/AUTOINCREMENT counter. The scheme was built so two machines
syncing through cr-sqlite could never assign the same PK to different rows.
Sync was retired (#8093) and there is one machine now, but the machine bits
are kept so every ID already stored stays unique against every new one, and
the IDs keep fitting SQLite's signed ``INTEGER`` (2^63 - 1) with no schema
change.

Bit layout (Snowflake-style, 63 bits total)
-------------------------------------------

    bit 62                    22 12          0
     [  timestamp_ms (41)  ][ mid(10) ][ ctr(12) ]
     MSB                                      LSB

- ``timestamp_ms`` (41 bits): milliseconds since ``PT_ID_EPOCH_MS``
  (2026-01-01T00:00:00Z). Rolls over in ~69 years (year 2095).
- ``machine_id`` (10 bits): 0..1023. Identifies the originating
  machine; kept so existing IDs never collide with new ones.
- ``counter`` (12 bits): monotonic counter within each millisecond,
  resets at each new ms. Overflow (4096 IDs in one ms on one machine)
  causes a busy-wait to the next ms — a nominal signal of an anomalous
  burst rate, not a realistic path.

Why 41/10/12 over TodoMVC's 32/16/16:
- ms instead of s timestamp: eliminates "same-second" collisions across
  fast process restarts and sub-second bursts.
- 12-bit counter: 4096/ms = 4M/s per machine, far above any burst
  scenario (agent-driven card factory, task_history on migration).

Machine ID assignment
---------------------

The 10 machine bits come from ``_metadata['pt.machine_id']`` (0..1023). On
the live database, migration 018 wrote the value the old cr-sqlite code had
derived from ``crsql_site_id()``, so IDs minted after the removal carry the
same machine bits as before. A database with no such row (fresh checkout,
tests) uses ``DEFAULT_MACHINE_ID``. IDs stay unique within one database
because the timestamp and counter bits differ; the machine bits only matter
for never colliding with IDs that already exist.

Monotonicity guarantees
-----------------------

- **Within a process:** IDs are strictly increasing. Time advances or
  counter increments; never the reverse.
- **Clock moves backward:** If the wall clock regresses (NTP step,
  laptop hibernation drift), ``next_id`` continues using the last
  observed ms and increments counter. If counter exhausts (rare), it
  advances last_ms by 1 and resets counter. This preserves
  monotonicity at the cost of ID space ahead of wall clock — a mild
  future-dating that resolves when real time catches up.
- **Across process restarts:** no guarantee of strict monotonicity
  across boundaries — IDs can repeat if the clock hasn't advanced and
  machine_id is the same. In practice: clock almost always advances
  between restarts. For strict cross-process monotonicity a persisted
  high-water mark would be required; we don't build that here because
  (a) uniqueness doesn't need it (machine_id plus the counter already
  prevent collisions) and (b) it adds IO per insert.

Collision analysis
------------------

Within one machine_id, two IDs collide only if they share a millisecond and
a counter value, which the counter prevents inside a process. Across process
restarts the clock almost always advances between starts.

**Usage**::

    from db.pt_id import next_id
    from db.schema import get_db_path

    new_id = next_id(db_path=get_db_path())
    conn.execute(
        "INSERT INTO tasks (id, title, ...) VALUES (?, ?, ...)",
        (new_id, title, ...),
    )

The generator is a process-wide thread-safe singleton. First call
performs ``machine_id`` resolution; subsequent calls reuse it.
