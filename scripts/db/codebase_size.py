"""Codebase size run storage for `pt size` (#8083).

Scanning and scoring live in ``scripts/codebase_size.py`` and have no database
code; this mixin only stores and reads ``codebase_size_snapshots``.

The table is append-only: rows are never updated or deleted (migration 017
adds triggers that abort either), so a stored measurement cannot be lost or
altered. Each ``pt size --snapshot`` inserts one complete run under a new
``run_id`` in a single transaction. The baseline is the earliest run and the
current measurement the newest; a same-day re-run simply adds a run.
