"""Remove cr-sqlite (#8093, decision D2).

Multi-machine sync is retired, so the CRR machinery goes: the three
``<table>__crsql_{i,u,d}trig`` triggers on each replicated table, the
``<table>__crsql_clock`` and ``<table>__crsql_pks`` bookkeeping tables (their
indexes go with them), and the ``crsql_master``, ``crsql_site_id`` and
``crsql_tracked_peers`` metadata tables. ``crsql_changes`` is a virtual view
of the extension and is not stored, so there is nothing to drop for it.

User tables and their rows are not touched, and no table is rebuilt.

Before dropping anything, the machine id the old code derived from
``crsql_site_id()`` is written to ``_metadata['pt.machine_id']`` (unless an
explicit value is already there), so every ID minted afterwards keeps the same
10 machine bits and stays collision-free against existing IDs. The hash is
the one ``db.pt_id`` used: the first two bytes of SHA-256 over the local
(ordinal 0) site id, masked to 10 bits.

Objects are discovered from ``sqlite_master`` rather than listed, and every
DROP uses IF EXISTS, so the migration is a no-op on a fresh database or on
one that never had cr-sqlite. It works without the extension loaded: the
triggers are plain SQL objects and can be dropped like any others.

Destructive: ``pt db migrate`` takes and verifies a full backup first.
