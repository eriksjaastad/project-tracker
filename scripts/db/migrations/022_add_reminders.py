"""Add the reminders table for #8282 (the dashboard's Erik's Reminders page).

Each row is one thing Erik wants to remember he has: a tool, guide, research
note, tip or decision, with why or when to reach for it and where it lives.
An item retires when its content is built into a process, skill or tool
(built_in_at) or when Erik removes it (deleted_at). Rows are never
hard-deleted, so a retired or removed reminder can still be found.

Classification: LOCAL_ONLY, like every table since migration 018. The same
DDL reaches fresh databases through the generated schema.sql; IF NOT EXISTS
makes this migration a no-op on a database that already has it.
