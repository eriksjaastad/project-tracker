"""Add the outreach_contacts table for #7641.

A private, laptop-only list of people Erik wants to reach out to from the
Morning page. Names are personal data, so this table deliberately has no sync
contract: it is LOCAL_ONLY and only the outreach API endpoints return it.

Classification: LOCAL_ONLY. Contact rows never leave the laptop; the Mini has
no use for them and replicating private names would widen their exposure for
no benefit. The same DDL lives in schema.py for fresh databases; CREATE IF
NOT EXISTS makes this migration safe after either creation path. Rows are
never hard-deleted — application delete is a soft delete (deleted_at), and
"replied" rows stay in the table as finished lifecycle evidence.
