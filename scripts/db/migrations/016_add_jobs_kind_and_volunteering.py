"""Add jobs.kind and jobs.volunteering_since for the Volunteer tab (#101668605654102016).

Volunteer roles share the jobs table's lifecycle — a listing, a dismissal,
repeatable submissions — so they live in it rather than a parallel table.
``kind`` separates them ('job' | 'volunteer'); the Jobs page, stats and
submissions read only 'job' rows. ``volunteering_since`` records when Erik
actually started volunteering somewhere, which moves a role from "Applied"
to "Currently volunteering".

Before this column existed, volunteer roles were entered by hand as
``source='manual'`` rows titled ``Volunteer: <role>``. The backfill below
converts exactly those rows to ``kind='volunteer'`` and strips the prefix.
It touches only rows still marked 'job', so a second run changes nothing.

Classification: LOCAL_ONLY, like migration 013 — ``jobs`` has no sync
contract. Additive only: two ADD COLUMNs and one UPDATE, no rebuild, no
DROP. Fresh databases get both columns from the CREATE TABLE in schema.py,
so each ALTER is skipped when its column already exists.
