"""
Migration runner for project-tracker.

Reads migration modules from ``scripts/db/migrations/``, applies any that
aren't already recorded in the local ``schema_migrations`` ledger, and wraps
each apply in a SQL transaction together with its ledger row, so a failed
migration leaves neither DDL nor a ledger entry behind.

Migration file format
---------------------
Files live in ``scripts/db/migrations/`` and match ``NNN_name.py`` where
``NNN`` is a 3-digit version number. Each module must expose:

- ``up(conn: sqlite3.Connection) -> None`` — applies the migration.
  Called inside an already-open transaction; must **not** issue
  ``BEGIN``, ``COMMIT``, or ``ROLLBACK``.

Older modules also carry a ``CRR_TABLES`` frozenset left over from the
cr-sqlite era (removed by migration 018). The runner ignores it.

Files under ``migrations/`` whose basename doesn't match ``NNN_name.py``
(``__init__.py``, dotfiles, editor backups) are ignored silently. Files
that match the naming pattern but lack ``up()`` — for example the legacy,
deprecated ``001_add_review_status.py`` that pre-dates this runner — emit a
stderr warning on discovery and are skipped. They will never be applied.
