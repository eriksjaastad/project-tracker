"""Read-only usage stats from ai-memory's brain.db for the /agentic page.

ai-memory owns the schema; this module only reads its ``tool_invocations``

brain.db, a missing table or column) raises BrainStatsUnavailable instead of
returning empty series, so the page shows the error, not a "no data yet" chart.
