# 🛡️ Ecosystem Governance & Review Protocol (v1.3)

**Date:** 2026-01-27
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Goal:** Transition from "Rapid Experimentation" to "Industrial-Grade Hardening."

---

## 🏛️ Part 1: The Core Architecture (Checklist-First)
*Intelligence belongs in the checklist, not the prompt.*

### 1. The Fundamental Pivot
Prompts are subjective and mood-dependent; checklists are versioned, auditable specifications of what "reviewed" means.
*   **Evidence-First Rule:** Every check requires an evidence field (e.g., a `grep` output). Empty evidence = Incomplete Review.
*   **The Artifact:** The review deliverable is a completed evidence trail, not an unstructured prose opinion.

### 2. The Blast Radius Prioritization
Audit files in order of their potential to infect the ecosystem:
1.  **Tier 1: Propagation Sources (Highest Impact):** `templates/`, `.cursorrules`, `AGENTS.md`. If these fail, every downstream project inherits the defect.
2.  **Tier 2: Execution Critical:** `scripts/`, `scaffold/`. These run the automation but don't propagate DNA.
3.  **Tier 3: Documentation:** `Documents/`, `patterns/`. Important for humans, zero impact on code execution.

---

## 🏛️ Part 2: The Two-Layer Defense Model

### Layer 1: Robotic Scan (Gatekeeper)
A mechanical script (`pre_review_scan.sh`) that catches hardcoded paths, secrets, and silent errors. A single "FAIL" blocks the AI/Human review. This is integrated into the `Project-workflow.md` (lives at projects root) as the mandatory Gate 0.

### Layer 2: Cognitive Audit (Architect Work)
AI Architects focus on judgment-heavy tasks that automation misses:
*   **Inverse Test Analysis:** For every passing test, document what is **NOT** being checked. Identify the "Dark Territory."
*   **Temporal Risk Analysis:** Identify what breaks in 1, 6, or 12 months (e.g., unpinned dependencies, API deprecations).
*   **Propagation Impact:** Verify that Tier 1 files contain no machine-specific assumptions.

---

## 🏛️ Part 3: The Industrial Hardening Audit
*Mandatory checks for projects transitioning from Prototype to Production.*

### 1. The "Data Clobber" Guard
Reviewers must verify that any script writing to global or external paths (e.g., `agent-skills-library`) includes:
*   **Path Validation:** Explicit check that the destination directory exists and is valid.
*   **Dry-Run Mandate:** A `--dry-run` flag that parses all logic but performs zero disk writes.
*   **Safety Gate:** Refuse to write if the `target_path` is not explicitly validated against a whitelist of project roots.

**Database Operations (Added 2026-01-27 after 94-task data loss):**

Reviewers must verify that any code performing database DELETE operations includes:
*   **CASCADE Awareness:** Document foreign key relationships. A `DELETE FROM projects` may cascade to tasks, history, etc.
*   **Backup Before Delete:** Bulk deletions (>1 row) must create a backup first (JSON export or table copy).
*   **Confirmation Gate:** Auto-cleanup logic (e.g., "delete stale entries") requires explicit user confirmation, not silent execution.
*   **No Unrequested Cleanup:** Never add "delete items not found" logic without explicit authorization from the Conductor.

**The 2026-01-27 Incident:** An AI added unrequested auto-delete logic to a scan function. When the scan temporarily found zero projects (due to path issues), it deleted all projects, which CASCADE-deleted 94 tasks. This section exists to prevent that class of failure.

### 1b. Feature Authorization (Scope Creep Prevention)
Reviewers must verify that code changes do not introduce unrequested destructive behavior:
*   **Authorization Check:** Any new DELETE, DROP, TRUNCATE, or cleanup logic must trace to an explicit user request.
*   **Scope Boundary:** "Helpful" additions that weren't asked for are defects, not features—especially if destructive.
*   **The Test:** Ask "Did the Conductor explicitly request this behavior?" If no, reject it.

### 2. Subprocess Integrity
Every `subprocess.run` call must follow the **Production Standard**:
*   `check=True`: Fail loudly on non-zero exit codes.
*   `timeout=X`: Never allow a subprocess to hang indefinitely (e.g., `yt-dlp` or `ollama` hangs).
*   `capture_output=True`: Ensure stdout/stderr are captured for telemetry if a failure occurs.

### 3. Frontmatter & Schema Validation
For projects that generate files:
*   **Schema Enforcement:** Generated markdown must be validated against the project's frontmatter taxonomy.
*   **Escape Verbatim:** Verbatim text (like transcripts) must be escaped or truncated to prevent breaking YAML parser logic.

### 4. Test Fixture Integrity
For projects with filesystem or external dependencies:
*   **Isolation Mandate:** All tests must use temporary directories (`tmp_path`, `tempfile`). No tests should read/write to real project paths.
*   **Realistic Structures:** Fixtures must create file structures that mirror production (not empty dirs or single files).
*   **Mock External Calls:** `subprocess.run`, network calls, and system queries must be mocked to prevent flaky tests.
*   **Composable Fixtures:** Build complex fixtures from simpler ones (e.g., `project_with_wikilinks` builds on `project_with_markdown`).
*   **No Weak Assertions:** Tests must verify specific values and behaviors, not just types. `assert isinstance(result, list)` is insufficient; `assert len(result) > 0` and `assert result[0].field == expected` are required.

### 5. Placeholder Integrity (Gate 2)
Every scaffolded project must be validated for unfilled template placeholders:
*   **The Check:** Run `scripts/validate_project.py` or `scripts/audit_all_projects.py`.
*   **The Standard:** Zero results for `{{VAR}}` patterns in any `.md`, `.py`, or `.sh` files.
*   **The Enforcement:** A single unfilled placeholder triggers a **Scaffolding Failure** alert to Discord.

### 6. Silent Failure Prevention (Added 2026-01-27)
Functions that discover, scan, or aggregate data must NEVER silently return empty results when the underlying operation failed:
*   **No Silent Empty Returns:** `return []` without logging is a defect. If a directory doesn't exist, LOG a warning, don't just return empty.
*   **Distinguish "Nothing Found" from "Couldn't Look":** A scanner finding 0 items in a valid directory is different from a scanner failing to read the directory.
*   **The Pattern:**
    ```python
    # BAD - Silent failure
    if not base.exists():
        return []  # Caller has no idea why

    # GOOD - Explicit failure
    if not base.exists():
        logger.warning(f"Directory does not exist: {base}")
        return []  # Caller can see the warning in logs
    ```
*   **Exception Handling Required:** `iterdir()`, `glob()`, and similar filesystem operations can raise `PermissionError`, `OSError`. Wrap in try/except with logging.

**The 2026-01-27 Incident Context:** The `discover_projects()` function returned an empty list when PROJECTS_ROOT pointed to a non-existent path. No warning was logged. Downstream code interpreted "0 projects" as "delete everything not found."

### 7. Environment Variable Standards
Critical environment variables that affect data paths must be validated:
*   **PROJECTS_ROOT Standard:**
    - Must be validated at startup (exists, is directory, is readable)
    - Empty string fallback to cwd is FORBIDDEN (use explicit default or fail)
    - Log the resolved path at startup for debugging
*   **Validation Pattern:**
    ```python
    # BAD - Empty string becomes cwd silently
    PROJECTS_ROOT = Path(os.getenv("PROJECTS_ROOT", ""))

    # GOOD - Explicit validation
    projects_root = os.getenv("PROJECTS_ROOT")
    if not projects_root:
        projects_root = Path(__file__).parent.parent  # Explicit default
        logger.info(f"PROJECTS_ROOT not set, using {projects_root}")
    PROJECTS_ROOT = Path(projects_root)
    if not PROJECTS_ROOT.is_dir():
        raise ValueError(f"PROJECTS_ROOT is not a directory: {PROJECTS_ROOT}")
    ```
*   **The Test:** If an env var is unset, does the code behave predictably? If the answer is "it uses cwd" or "it silently fails," that's a defect.

### 8. Performance Guards
Filesystem operations that scale with codebase size must be bounded:
*   **No Unbounded Recursive Globs:** `any(item.glob("**/*.py"))` scans the ENTIRE subtree. For 35+ projects with node_modules, this is catastrophic.
*   **Alternatives:**
    - Check only root-level files: `any(item.glob("*.py"))`
    - Check specific known locations: `(item / "src").exists()`
    - Use cached metadata from prior scans
    - Limit depth: `item.glob("*/*.py")` (one level deep)
*   **Sanity Checks for Zero Results:** If a scanner expects to find items (e.g., projects in PROJECTS_ROOT) and finds zero, emit a WARNING. Don't silently proceed with destructive operations.

## 🏛️ Part 4: Scalability Analysis
*Reviewers must document the "Ceiling" of the current architecture.*

### 1. The Context Window Limit
Any logic that aggregates multiple files (e.g., `synthesize.py` reading an entire library) must be flagged for:
*   **The Truncation Risk:** When does the library size exceed the LLM's context window?
*   **Strategy:** Is there a Map-Reduce, RAG, or Tiered Synthesis plan for scale?

### 2. Repository Bloat
Audit for logic that dumps massive verbatim data (e.g., 2-hour video transcripts) into the main repository. Recommend strategies for externalizing large assets if they don't serve the core LLM reasoning.

---

## 🧠 Part 5: Continual Learning (The Control Loop)
*How we turn "Scars" into "Standards."*

### 1. The "Scar Tissue" SLA
Any new defect type found must be added to the **Robotic Scan** and the **Checklist** within **24 hours**.

### 2. Regression Harnessing
Every bug found must result in a **Reproducer Test** in CI. These tests are the "immune system" of the repo.

### 3. Context-Aware "Mission Orders" (RISEN)
Use the **RISEN Framework** (Role, Instructions, Steps, Expectations, Narrowing) to create a behavioral contract for the auditor.
