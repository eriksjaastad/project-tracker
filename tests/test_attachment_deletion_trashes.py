"""Attachment files must be trashed, never unlinked (#6905).

Both delete paths destroyed user-uploaded content outright, so a misclick in
the dashboard removed a file with no recovery. Erik's standing rule: send2trash
for anything that is not a temp file the same process just created.

These tests exist because the fix shipped with no coverage at all — nothing
stopped a later edit quietly restoring `.unlink()`. They assert the mechanism,
not just the outcome, since "the file is gone" is true either way.
