"""Tests for #7657 (follow-up to #7147): clustered-edge collapsing in
GET /api/ai-memory with cluster=on.

When dust nodes collapse into a per-type cluster node, two distinct things
can happen to the edges between them:

1. Multiple original edges can remap onto the SAME (cluster, cluster, type)
   key. _AI_MEMORY_EDGE_SELECT orders by weight DESC and the app-level dedup
   in get_ai_memory_graph keeps only the first (strongest) survivor per key.
2. An edge between two dust nodes of the SAME type collapses onto a
   self-loop (source cluster == target cluster) and is dropped entirely by
   the `!=` guard in _AI_MEMORY_EDGE_FROM — it never reaches the dedup step
   or the response.

This fixture builds two dust clusters (3 "concept" nodes, 3 "task" nodes,
all mention_count <= 2 and degree <= 5) with:
  - one intra-concept edge (1 -> 2) that collapses to a concept/concept
    self-loop, which must be dropped,
  - three concept -> task edges (1->4, 2->5, 3->6) that all collapse to the
    same (concept_cluster, task_cluster, 'relates_to') key, of which only
    the strongest (2->5, weight 200) must survive.

All brain.db access goes through a tmp_path fixture; the real
~/projects/ai-memory/brain.db is never touched.

    Node ids 1-3 are type 'concept', ids 4-6 are type 'task'. All have

    "dust" per _cluster_dust_nodes and each type group (size 3) is large
