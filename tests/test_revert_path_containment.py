"""`migration finish --revert` must never touch anything outside its repo (#6890).

`_revert_paths` built its delete target as `repo_dir / entry["path"]` and
checked only `if not target.exists()`. pathlib discards the left-hand side when
the right-hand side is absolute, so a recorded path of `/abs/path/to/other-repo`
resolved to that other repo — and the next line handed it to `send2trash`.
`""` and `"."` both resolve to the repository root itself, so either would have
trashed the whole repo the revert was running in.

That is not a theoretical hole. It is what sent a sibling project to the Trash
while its developers were working, and it left no shell history and no hook log
because the deletion happened inside a Python call in another repo's process.

These tests build a real sibling directory next to a real repo and assert it
survives. Anything that can delete has to prove it cannot reach outside.
