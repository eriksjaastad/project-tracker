"""Regression test for #6963: leaked SQLite handle in /api/open-brain.

`dashboard/app.py`'s `get_open_brain_graph` (the `/api/open-brain` and
`/api/knowledge-graph` handler) opened its brain.db connection with
`with sqlite3.connect(brain_db_path) as conn:`. That construct manages the
*transaction* (commit on success, rollback on exception) — sqlite3.Connection
has no `__exit__` that calls `close()`. So the handle was never closed on
either the success path or the exception path; it was only reclaimed
whenever the object happened to be garbage collected. This is the same
"unable to open database file" rot fixed for three sibling endpoints in
#6954 (see tests/test_dashboard_sqlite_leak_fix.py) — #6954's commit
explicitly called out this site as the one that still needed it, since
`with conn:` looks like a fix but isn't.

This test forces both a successful request and a failing query through the
endpoint and asserts the underlying sqlite3.Connection.close() actually
runs in both cases (via a sqlite3.Connection subclass passed as `factory=`,
since Connection instances don't allow attribute monkeypatching).
