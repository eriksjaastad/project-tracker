"""The board must not render a blocked card as unblocked (#6885).

`task_lookup.get(blocked_id)` dropped misses silently, so a card whose blockers
were not in the fetched set came back with `is_blocked = False`. That is the
dashboard's version of #6747, where `pt tasks show` printed "(all resolved)"
for a card that was genuinely blocked — the failure states the opposite of the
truth, which is worse than an error.

A miss has two causes that must not be conflated: the blocker may be archived
(Done, excluded by default since #6870, so genuinely not blocking), or it may
not exist at all.
