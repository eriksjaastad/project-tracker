"""Done-column retention: archive, never delete (#6870).

`pt tasks done` used to call `trim_done_tasks(keep=75)`, which counted Done
cards portfolio-wide with no project filter and hard-DELETEd everything past
75. A busy project's completions evicted a quiet project's history — 1,288
Done cards were destroyed, 244 of them project-tracker's — and because the
delete cascaded to `task_history` it erased its own evidence.

These tests pin the replacement behavior: retention is a *display* concern.
Cards past the per-project cap get `archived_at` stamped and drop off the
board; the rows, their status, and their completion timestamps all survive.
