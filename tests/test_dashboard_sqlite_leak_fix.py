"""Regression tests for #6954: leaked SQLite handles on the error path.

`dashboard/app.py` had three brain.db call sites that did
`conn = sqlite3.connect(...)` inside a bare `try:` and called `conn.close()`
only on the happy path. Any exception raised between open and close (a bad
query, a locked file, a corrupt row) skipped the close and leaked the file
handle — the same "unable to open database file" rot documented in
test_dashboard_health.py, just from a different angle (handle exhaustion
instead of a single rotted handle).

These tests force a query failure inside each of the three fixed endpoints
and assert the underlying sqlite3.Connection.close() still runs.
