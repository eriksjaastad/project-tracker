"""Pin the card-prompt workflow footer.

`pt tasks create --prompt` staples a Workflow Protocol checklist onto every
card prompt. Nothing used to test that text, and it drifted unnoticed for seven
months: it told agents `Awaiting Conductor sign-off` and
``FORBIDDEN: `./pt tasks done` (Conductor only)``, naming a role that is defined
nowhere in the portfolio and forbidding the completion step the Kanban rules
require. That reached 168 cards across 34 projects before anyone noticed, and
the only reason it was found is that a floor manager obeyed it and stalled.

These tests exist so the next drift fails CI instead of shipping. The footer is
asserted verbatim, not by keyword, because the failure mode was wording -- a
substring check for "Workflow Protocol" would have passed the whole time.

The four steps mirror the canonical card walk in the `## Kanban Rules` section
of the portfolio `CLAUDE.md`. If that walk changes, change EXPECTED_FOOTER in
the same commit and say so in the message.
