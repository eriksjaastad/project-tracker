"""Import and name resolution in the project graph stays inside a project.

Each project under ~/projects is its own repository, so an import or a bare
file name can only mean a file in the importing project. The resolvers used
to search the whole portfolio and take the first hit, which turned stdlib and
npm imports into edges to unrelated files elsewhere (``import re`` ->
``beta/store.py``) and dragged large projects into the middle of /graph.
